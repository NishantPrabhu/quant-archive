# Dicey Situation

1. **You have 3 six-sided dice and I have one 20-sided die. You roll all the three dice simultaneously and your score is the sum of the numbers you get. I roll my die once and my score is the number on the die. The person with a higher score wins. Who is more likely to win?**

**Answer**: Our first guess is checking the expected score for both sides, like so:

$$
\textrm{For the three dice:}\; \mathbb{E}\left( X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3} \right) = \mathbb{E}X_{1} + \mathbb{E}X_{2} + \mathbb{E}X_{3} = 3 \times \frac{21}{6} = 10.5 
$$

$$
\textrm{For the 20 sided die:}\; \mathbb{E}X = \frac{1}{20}\sum_{i=1}^{20}i = 10.5 
$$

One could guess from here that they both are equally likely to win. But that's not enough: we also need to ensure that the expected value has the highest probability of occuring. Since the experiments above follow a binomial distribution, we know that the mean will have the highest probability, thus concluding the answer.
